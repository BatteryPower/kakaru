kakaru is an open hardware control board for the MultiWii software project.

It is designed to be compact, inexpensive, and reasonably easy to hand assemble.

To avoid requiring soldering SMD packages without exposed pads, the sensors are attached from breakout boards. The ATAVRSBIN1 IMU evaluation board from Atmel is used for a compass, magnetometer, and accelerometer. A BMP085 on a sparkfun breakout board provides a pressure sensor. These sensors allow for altitude hold, yaw hold, and auto level.

The board is intended to be powered though the battery elimination circuit (BEC) line of electronic speed controller (ESC). Place a zero ohm resistor for resistor R6 to connect one of the ESC's BEC lines. Populating both R5 and R6 will connect all four ESCs in parallel.

The rectangles on the silkscreen layer near headers mark ground.

The connections to the BMP085 and ATAVRSBIN1 are new have not been tested. Boards should arrive some time in mid September. The remainder of the board was tested in a previous hardware revision.

Schematic and board files were made using CadSoft's EAGLE PCB design software.
